## Introduction

The chatbot is built using the GPT-2 language model and can be used for various natural language processing tasks, including answering questions, providing information, and engaging in conversations. This README provides an overview of the project, including how to install, use, and train the chatbot.

## Features

- Multi-turn conversation handling.
- Adaptation to context.
- Question answering on a wide range of topics.
- Easy-to-use data preprocessing and training pipeline.
- Customizable for specific applications.

## Installation

To get started with the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:




2. Install the required dependencies:



This will start an interactive session where you can input questions or statements, and the chatbot will generate responses based on the GPT-2 model.

## Preprocessing

Before training the chatbot, you can preprocess your dataset to prepare it for training. The preprocessing steps include:

- Data cleaning and formatting.
- Tokenization and padding.
- Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

You can customize the preprocessing pipeline based on your dataset and requirements.

## Training

To train the chatbot on the dataset (Stnford Question Answering Dataset), follow these steps:

1. Mount google drive and upload the .json file (located at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stanfordu/stanford-question-answering-dataset)
2. Prepare dataset in the required format.
3. Use the provided script or customize it for your specific dataset needs.
4. Perform an EDA to understand the data.
5. Train the model. 
6. Evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset.

Detailed instructions for training are available in the training documentation.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the chatbot's performance, you can use various metrics such as BLEU score, perplexity, and user feedback. Additionally, you can conduct user studies to assess the chatbot's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
